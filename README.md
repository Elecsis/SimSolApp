Survey app that ask 5 question built in  AdonisJS | mySQL | NodeJS | Bootstrap

here is the coding challenge I would like you to solve.

I would like you to create a very basic application using the following stack:

* NodeJS with AdonisJS as the framework (If you are not familiar with AdonisJS, please use any framework for Node)
* MySQL
* Nginx
* Any frontend framework you like (HTML/CSS, ReactJS, AngularJS or Vue.js) or the views from the MVC framework (AdonisJS)

The application is simple as this is only a test. What we need to have is a web form with 5 questions (You can make up the questions). Answers to the web form will be saved on to the database. We need to be able to visualize those answers on a table in an admin portal… This admin portal again is simple, one page with a table showing entry ID, Q1 answer, Q2 answer, etc.  This admin portal should be protected by a login… No need to make a user module, but probably safe to register one admin user in the database. Upon answering the questions and submitting the form we should obtain the following two results:

*An email should go out to the administrator - email contents can be the answers and a random subject line…
*Show a confirmation screen or message that says “Thank you for sending the information” or something like that.

In your development I would like you to use Adonis.JS as the framework for the backend. 


This is my attempt at this challenge.
